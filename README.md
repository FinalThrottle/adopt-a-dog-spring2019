Adoptadog

Throughout the years, the trend of adopting seems to be increasing. Rather than being in search for newly bred puppies, potential dog owners are looking to adopt.

The goal of Adoptadog is to help over a hundred animals within Washington find a great home, and to be apart of a family. However, a lot of individuals just don’t have time to physically go to a shelter in order to spend time and take a look. By creating Adoptadog, there is an increase in accessibility for potential dog owners as they can now access our website at the comfort of their own home or anywhere they please. Customers will be able to view dogs that are available to be adopted, and the prices for their adoption. What’s best is that content is updated almost daily!

Each dog comes with a brief summary of his or her age, breed, and personality.  Browse through and once you believe you found the perfect one, click “Adopt” in order to proceed and you will be able to take a new family member home!
